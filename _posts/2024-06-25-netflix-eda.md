### Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix TV Shows and Movies with Pandas and NumPy**

The goal of this data analysis was to explore the Netflix dataset and find interesting insights about the shows and movies on the platform.

The Netflix dataset has lots of information, like the titles of shows, what year they were released, who directed them, the cast, and viewer ratings. I used a Python library called Pandas to dig into this data and uncover patterns and trends.

One thing I looked at was which types of shows and movies are most popular on Netflix. I found certain genres, directors, and actors that viewers really love. It was also interesting to see how the popular titles have changed over the years.

The insights from this project could help Netflix make better decisions about what content to offer. By understanding what viewers like, they can choose shows and movies that will keep people watching and happy with the service.
